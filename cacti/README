CACTI command line format:

cacti C A

where,

C            = Capacity of cache or plain RAM (in bytes)
A            = Associativity (Enter 0 for full associativity)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Partial output data from CACTI is written into the out.csv file. Please modify
output_data_csv function in io.c to suit your needs.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By default, CACTI calls 4 worker threads to compute the area/power/delay of
valid cache configurations.  If you would like to call more worker threads,
make it with

  make NTHREADS=N

where N is the number of worker threads.
